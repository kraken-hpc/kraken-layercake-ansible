# Kraken/Layercake/Ansible

***Please excuse our dust.  The kraken/layercake project has recently been split from the main kraken project.  These roles are curreently broken, but we're working actively on getting them up to speed!***

This repository contains a set of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles taht can be used to deploy a [Kraken](https://github.com/kraken-hpc/kraken)/[Layercake](https://github.com/kraken-hpc/kraken-layercake) cluster.

For most modern systems, configuration management should be the ultimate source of truth for configuration information for a system.  To that end, we provide some ansible roles that can control Kraken.

The ansible roles in this directory serve two purposes:

1. To provide a template for anyone wishing to develop ansible management for a Layercake-based system;
2. To provide ansible to be used in the kraken/Layercake examples.
